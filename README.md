> Example Cypress tests going from page objects to app actions

This repo was used as an example in these blog posts:

- [Stop using Page Objects and Start using App Actions](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/03/stop-using-page-objects-and-start-using-app-actions/)
- [Convert Cypress Specs from JavaScript to TypeScript](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-js-to-ts/).
- [Run Just The Failed Tests In Cypress](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/run-failed-tests/)

## Steps

Each step is a Git tag. You can check out particular tag, install dependencies and run application and tests. Usually it would be:

```shell
git checkout <tag>
npm install
npm start
# from another terminal
npm run cypress
```

1. `00-start` just TodoMVC application running at `localhost:8888`
2. `01-first-test` adds Cypress and first end-to-end test in [spec.js](cypress/integration/spec.js)
3. `02-tests` brings a lot of tests from [cypress-example-todomvc](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-todomvc) to [spec.js](cypress/integration/spec.js). All tests work through UI (page), sometimes using custom commands defined in [cypress/support/commands.js](cypress/support/commands.js)
4. `03-page-object` drives app via page object [todo.page.js](cypress/integration/todo.page.js)
5. `04-app-actions` controls application by mostly directly calling the [model instance](js/todoModel.js) directly to avoid always going through the page.
6. `05-types` adds TypeScript [model interface](cypress/integration/model.d.ts) so our tests know the app actions [they can trigger](cypress/integration/utils.js)
7. `06-split` splits all tests into multiple spec files.
8. `07-grep` added tags and the [@bahmutov/cy-grep](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-grep) plugin.
9. `08-tags` tags the features and creates the ways to run CircleCI and GitHub Actions by selecting the tags to run.
10. `09-regression` tags some tests as `@regression` and updates the CI workflows.
11. `10-typescript` shows all specs written in TypeScript and passing the static types check.
12. `11-config-ts` moves `cypress.config.js` to TypeScript

## Tests

All tests are in folder [cypress/integration](cypress/integration). Common test settings are in [cypress.json](cypress.json) file.

## Workflows

This repo shows how to use manual workflows to select the tests to run.

![Starting a test run from GitHub UI](./images/workflows.png)

- [repeat-test.yml](./.github/workflows/repeat-test.yml) lets you run a test N times by entering part of the test's title
- [repeat-tag.yml](./.github/workflows/repeat-tag.yml) lets you run all tests tagged with specific tag
- [repeat-spec.yml](./.github/workflows/repeat-spec.yml) lets you repeat the same spec multiple times

## IntelliSense

In the application code [js/app.jsx](js/app.jsx) we set `window.model = ...` to expose our model instance for app actions to work. If we use TypeScript check via `// @ts-check` directive, we need to "tell" TS compiler that there is a new property `model` on the global `window` object. We can do this by writing file [cypress/integration/model.d.ts](cypress/integration/model.d.ts) with interface definition for `TodoModel` and `window` update. Something like this

```ts
interface TodoModel {
  todos: unknown[]
  addTodo(...todos: string[])
  // more methods
}
// During tests there we set "window.model" property
// now cy.window() returns Window instance with
// the "model" property that has TodoModel interface
interface Window {
  model: TodoModel
}
```

From our JavaScript spec files, we need to load this `model.d.ts` file, and we can do this using special `/// <reference>` comment.

```js
// type definitions for Cypress object "cy"
/// <reference types="cypress" />
// type definition for out TodoModel
/// <reference path='./model.d.ts' />
// @ts-check
```

Now whenever you use `cy.window().its('model')` command, IntelliSense will correctly suggest the "model" property.

And you can invoke the right methods on the `window.model`
